## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
Hello! Im Ciro, 16 year old developer from Colombia. I usually program with java, but i also like using every type of language :).

Updated: 29/4/2023


## üí≠ Proyects <a name = "working"></a>

The huge mayority of my proyects are for Spigot plugins, but not all of them:
- Arduino Circuits: Im constantly using arduino as a new way to understand circuits and using C++ in a new way.
- EzRename: Is a free resource used to add Lore and a Custom Name to items. Found in [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/ezrename.109242/)!
- NaoHCF: Nao is a paid plugin **UNDER DEVELOPMENT** made by me. A full HCF core for all uses, more info is given below.
- vCore: Is a free resource **UNDER DEVELOPMENT** by me and [RodriDevs](https://github.com/RodriDevs). Have all your neccessary commands and functions in just 1 plugin!

More proyects are in their way!

## ü§ñ Arduino <a name = "arduino"></a>

My arduino proyects can be found in this [repo](https://github.com/CiroSanchezB/arduino-projects). This are very useful and may contain a circuit map, everything is accepted, add me on Discord: voidCiroo#0001.


## üßÉ NaoHCF <a name = "nao"></a>

Nao HCF is my biggest proyect in the moment, i always liked HCF and well, why not make a Core for a cheap price? Nowadays, cores have a very high price and the people that need one can't pay 30 dollars, here is your salvation.

**UNDER DEVELOPMENT**

Nao contains all features for a full HCF core, such as: Territory saving, Factions, KoTHs, Cooldowns, Chat Formatting, Scoreboard and TAB, LunarAPI, Rank System compatibilty, Reclaim, and more.

Keep updated with sneek-peaks in my [discord](https://dsc.gg/voidciroo).


## üöÄ vCore <a name = "vcore"></a>

vCore is a full configurable basic core for your server, need something simple? Here it is. All the functions, commands, and more, are given in my [discord](https://dsc.gg/voidciroo).

With [RodriDevs](https://github.com/RodriDevs), we're keeping this updated and developed.

**Under Development**


## ü•§ Experience <a name = "xp"></a>

### Programming
Im programming since 2021, started using python and then C#, some C++ and Java were in the way to today.

#### Languages:
- Python: Python is the most common language to start to program, theres my first code, i use python for Discord.py and some MySQL.
- C#: C# was the first semi-complex language i used, i developed my first app there "EzTweaks", used to mantain your pc up to date and clean.
- Java: C# and Java are the same, but Java is most used, that's why i like it so much.
- C++: C++ is used for everything, casual programming, arduino, Unreal Engine, etc.

#### Participation:
- GameJam 2022: I participated in GGJ 2022 with a group of my school, in result [DearMe](https://globalgamejam.org/2023/games/dear-me-7). Pretty shitty game, good experience.
